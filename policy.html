        <h2 class="rules-text" id="rules-title">Rules</h2>
        <p class="rules-text" id="rules-desc">Like many other servers on the platform, rules are set in order to keep the community and its members safe. Though regular moderation is in place to guide people onto the right path, moderators should not be viewed as a means to restrict you from chatting. They are only there to act as a means of enforcement of the rules and will only take action when someone is endangering another member or the community. With that being said, here are the rules in this server:</p>
        <div class="rules">
            <div class="rule-list">
                <div class="rule" id="rule-1">
                    <h3>Rule 1</h3>
                    <p>No doxxing or harassment (especially threats on someone’s life/property) or encouraging self harm. See the <a class="rule-link" href="https://discord.com/safety/doxxing-policy-explainer">Doxing Policy Explainer</a> for more information.</p>

                    <h3>Rule 2</h3>
                    <p>No spamming, phishing, or attempting to steal another user’s account (broadly speaking, one could consider this “no spamming or scamming”).</p>
                </div>
